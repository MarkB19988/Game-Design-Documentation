### Story

A decade long war has been raging across runeterra between the dwarves and the orcs. The only hope of ending this slaughter and defeating the orcs is to wield the ancient warhammer, a weapon made centuries ago from skyforge steel and imbued with the power of the forge god himself. However the hammer is not so easily obtained, it has been separated into 3 parts and scattered throughout the forest of despair in order to stop it from inadvertently coming into the wrong hands. You alone must quest into the forest to find the 3 parts and piece together this ancient weapon of immense power and return back to the dwarves so they may yet have a chance at fighting this scourge.


### Character Creation

#### Stats

###### PERCEPTION
Perception allows the player to see further into the distance. 1-4 the player can only see 1 tile in front of them. 5-9 the player can make out rough shapes of objects 2 tiles away. 10 the player is able to clearly see 2 tiles in front of them.

##### ENDURANCE
Endurance determines how far the player may move at a time. Passing through a tile only gives a chance to encounter an enemy. 1-3 the player may move 1 tile, 4-6 the player may move 2 tiles, 7-9 the player may move 3 tiles. 10 reduces the chance for an encounter while travelling through tiles even further. Endurance also affects how much stamina is drained by attacking.
